# BMRE
Bounded-Memory Runtime Enforcer.
The bounded-memory enforcement monitoring algorithm is implemented in Python. The functionality is divided into two modules, DFA and  Enforcer modules. The DFA module contains all the functionalities related to defining the automaton and operations on the automaton. The Enforcer module implements the bounded-memory enforcement algorithm.
